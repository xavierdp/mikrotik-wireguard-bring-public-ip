# mikrotik-wireguard-bring-public-ip

The purpose is to bring an public IP from a IP BLOCK mounted in you network to another device like a computer or a raspberry pi device

I Installed a CHR Mikrotik inside a PROXMOX VM and i guess you have already a Mikrotik device or VM fully fonctionnal ready to use

The best at OVH is to get a professional dedicated server to connect to a VRACK et put the IP BLOCK inside

I took a less expensive dedicated server whith as small IP BLOCK, but in this case you have to associate manualy each IP address with the Mikrotik MAC address


### The basic configuration
